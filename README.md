This is my first attempt at a MCV pattern, it was fully made on Visual Studio, learnt alot, i am almost happy with the
outcome.I fully expearenced dunning kruger effect, but im glad i took abit of a risk to create something ive never worked with before. 
This was a great learning expearence.

Thank you for the oppertunity!
