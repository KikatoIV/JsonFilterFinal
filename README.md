# JsonFilterFinal

This is my first attempt at a MCV pattern, it was fully made on Visual Studio, learnt alot, i am almost happy with the
outcome. This was done in a TDD style, with constant testing and minimum working code, where possible, and with spare time improving and
adding more usefull features, i fully expearenced dunning kruger effect, but im glad i took abit of a risk to create something ive never worked with before. 
This was a great learning expearence.

Thank you for the oppertunity!
